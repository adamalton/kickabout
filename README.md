# Kick About

A Chrome extension that hides the project funding stats on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) to allow you to play the "Is it funded?" game.

Works best if you view [projects which are reaching their time limit](https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/advanced?woe_id=0&sort=end_date&seed=2466550)
