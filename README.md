# Kick About

A Chrome extension that hides the project funding stats on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) to allow you to play the "Is it funded?" game.

Stats are revealed if you hover the mouse over them (with a short delay to avoid accidental hovering).

Works best if you view [projects which are reaching their time limit](https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/advanced?woe_id=0&sort=end_date&seed=2466550)


## Installation

* Download this repository to a folder on your computer (there should be a download function on this GitHub page somewhere).
* In the Google Chrome web browser, visit [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and at the top check the "Developer mode" checkbox.
* Click "Load unpacked extension" and point it to the folder that you downloaded.
* Look at [projects which have nearly ended on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/advanced?woe_id=0&sort=end_date&seed=2466550) and because the stats are now hidden you can play the "Is it funded?" game!
